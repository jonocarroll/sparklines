Following the excellent {[reactR][reactR]} [tutorial][reactR vignette] on wrapping a React library, namely  [react-sparklines][react-sparklines].

## Example

This is successful, and produces a nice sparkline

``` r
sparklines(rnorm(10), sparklinesLine())
```

More could be wrapped, but this was a nice proof-of-concept.
